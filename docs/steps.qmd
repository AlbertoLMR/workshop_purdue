## GitHub Workshop

This workshop is intended to show common methods used to clone and upload repositories on GitHub. We will use R code to download occurrence data, process and clean spatial data, create static and interactive maps, and create documents using RStudio. CCB folks can work individually or in pairs. We will see just a glimpse of ***Tidyverse***, ***sf*** and ***Terra*** functions; however feel to ask for specific ways to analyze/clean data.

## Software

Please use the links provoded to download the latest versions of

1.  [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/)
2.  [R](https://cran.rstudio.com/)
3.  [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

Important: You don't need to remove previous versions of R installed in your computer. Those are important for running isolated R projects. You can select the version you want to use in RStudio with Tools/global_options/General

## 1) Packages

1.  Copy the following code and install the following packages in RStudio

```{r packages}
#| output: false

ipak <- 
  function(pkg){ 
    new.pkg <- 
      pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"])]
    if (length(new.pkg)) 
      install.packages(new.pkg, dependencies = TRUE)
    sapply(pkg, require, character.only = TRUE)}

# usage

packages <- 
  c(
    'renv',
    'rmarkdown',
    'quarto',
    'janitor',
    'rinat',
    'tidyverse', 
    'rgbif',
    'CoordinateCleaner',
    'tmap',
    'tmaptools',
    'sf',
    'terra',
    'remotes',
    'usethis')

ipak(packages)

#other packages

remotes::install_github("ropensci/scrubr")

```

## 2) Accounts

Open an account and set your profile in the following websites:

1.  [GitHub](https://github.com/)

2.  [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/) (keep at hand your username, password, and email)

3.  [INaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/)

Please

1- Create a folder in your desktop named CCB workshop

2- Create a subfolder named downloads. Use the following links to:

-   Download [world polygon](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/world-administrative-boundaries/export/?flg=en-us) Geographic file format/GeoJSON

-   Download the following [US polygons:](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html)

    -   County: cb_2018_us_county_500k.zip (11 MB)

    -   States: cb_2018_us_state_500k.zip (3.2 MB)

-   Download a global Digital Elevation Model [(DEM)](https://www.earthenv.org/topography). Use the following settings

![](dem_settings.jpg){fig-align="left"}

To set your GBIF account in RStudio please open RStudio and copy/run the following code. Make sure to have installed the package ***'usethis'*** in section1. **We will do this task during the workshop. Skip this.**

```{r}
#| output: false

rm(list = ls())

usethis::edit_r_environ()

# This will open a tab with your R environment .Renviron
# In that window copy the following lines and add your personal data

GBIF_USER = '' # add your GBIF username
GBIF_PWD = '' # add your GBIF password
GBIF_EMAIL = '' # add your GBIF email

# Run the code and restart RStudio after this

```
